ps- Building ML Models in Python with scikit-learn
by- Janana Ravi

Concepts:

Mean
Variance
Standard Deviation

Contiguous Data vs Categorical Data

Standardization of Data

Categorical Data and ordering
encode as numbers

One-hot Encoding
weekdays as an array vecto
monday = 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 
tuesday = 0 0 1 0 0 0 0

Sentiment analysis
Word embedding
one-hot
frequency based
prediction based (used by neural networks in deep learning)

text data in numerical form
CountVectorizer
TfidfVectorizer
HashingVectorizer

Regression

Linear Regression
L1, L2 norm
Variance-bias trade-off

underfitting
overfitting

Regularization
    reduces variance error but increases bias
Lasso & Ridge & Elastic Net Regression

Hperparameter tuning

SVM Regression
